# Project 13: Fun with Arrays
Create a two class project that allows that does the following:

## Main Class

    Pass over 50 random integers from 40 to 200 one at a time to the server class.
    Display the results of toString method in the server class.

## Server Class

    Make a global array that can hold 50 integer elements.
    Make a constructor method: This method will give life to the array, and all the global variables you need.
    Make a countOdds method: This method will count how many odd numbers are enterd into the array.
    Make a Maximum method: This method will determine the Maximum value in the array.
    Make a mean method: This method will determine the mean of the array.
    Make a toString method: This method will pass back all the results from the other three methods, that process the array.

## Extra Credit:

    Make a Mode method in the server class. The mode method will find the mode of the array.
    Make a quartile method in the server class. This method will determine the value of quartile 1 and quartile 3 of the array.
